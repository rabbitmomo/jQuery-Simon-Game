# jQuery-Simon-Game
This website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other internet resources. It serves as a project for learning the uses of jQuery, which is the JavaScript Library. Although it is a simple website, I thoroughly enjoyed creating it. If you encounter any issues with this project, please feel free to reach out to me.
